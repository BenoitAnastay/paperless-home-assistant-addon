# Paperless-ng Home Assistant Addon

## About

Paperless is an application that manages your personal documents. With the help of a document scanner (see [Scanner recommendations](https://paperless-ng.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scanners.html#scanners)), paperless transforms your wieldy physical document binders into a searchable archive and provides many utilities for finding and managing your documents.
