{% if channel == "stable" %}
``` yaml
- platform: rest
  unique_id: 5dade7bc-ddb7-442e-bb17-0d379dbf01fb
  resource: http://ca5234a0-paperless-ngx/api/documents/?tags__name__iexact=inbox
  headers:
    Authorization: !secret paperless_auth_header
  value_template: "{{'{{ value_json.count | int }}'}}"
  name: "Paperless Inbox"
  icon: mdi:inbox
```
{% endif %}
{% if channel == "edge" %}
``` yaml
